Improvements in future versions - 
    The created on is the version 1 of this application. Considering, there are and will be more additions to this one.

    eg. 
    1. Code optimization - When I started building, I created files, components, functions, variable as per my requirements. 
        So, in next version we can optimize this as per the requirements
    2. CSS - There are few repeatative usage of classes and attributes. That can be optimized
    3. Backend with NodeJS is created, but could not integrate with the Front-end as I got stuck in some of the functionalities
